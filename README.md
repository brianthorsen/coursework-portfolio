# coursework-portfolio
Various projects completed throughout my undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley.

Thus far, there are two main projects on display in this repository:

- Replication of the species area curve (ESPM 88B, Spring 2016), found in `Species Area Curve.Rmd`. This is a conversion to R of a project originally completed in Python using Jupyter; further explanation can be found in the project.

- Simulation and analysis of ad hoc networks (Stat 133, Fall 2016), found in `adHoc.Rmd`

As I continue my studies, I hope to add more projects and demonstrate new skills and growth, and possibly revisit old projects to improve upon the initial work. Feel free to look around and comment on the work; I leave this repository public as a means of receiving feedback from others, and to encourage others to do so as well.
